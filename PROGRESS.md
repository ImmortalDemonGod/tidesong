# Overnight build log

Goal (binding once the run starts): build the vertical slice of the agreed
underwater jam game per DESIGN.md in TypeScript + bun, in the style of the
TRUNK! overnight rebuild. Capture the merged design faithfully, iterate on
design, problem-finding, visuals, and bot playtests. Above all make it FUN
(loop + decisions + uncertainty + curve + juice).

Slice target, in priority order:
1. Turn-based combat core: stamina economy, conditions, disable refund
2. One regular enemy (vampire squid) fight, fully bot-verified
3. Boss 1 with limb targeting + phase break (the set-piece)
4. Hub reef: swim-around exploration, merfolk NPC, memory fragments
5. Relic gate: blocked without Tide Relic, parts with it (bot-asserted)
6. Dungeon 1 connecting hub to boss 1
7. Juice pass: water mood, hit feedback, condition VFX, sound if time
8. Stretch: song-seal puzzle door, dungeon 2 + boss 2

## State: SCAFFOLD READY, BUILD NOT STARTED

## Verification loop commands
- `~/.bun/bin/bun test` (bot suite; keep green at every commit)
- `~/.bun/bin/bun build.ts` then open `dist/index.html`
- Screenshots: `/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox --headless
  -no-remote --profile <tmpprofile> --screenshot out.png
  "file:///Users/tomriddle1/tidesong/dist/index.html"`
  (user's Firefox is open; -no-remote + temp profile required)
- Every feature round: implement, bun test, screenshot and LOOK at it,
  commit. Republish playable artifact periodically.

## Rules for the run
- No em dashes in any user-shareable text.
- No session-link trailers or AI co-author lines in commits.
- Placeholder art only; all real art is Glass_Goat's.
- game.ts stays pure simulation (no DOM); that is what makes bots possible.
